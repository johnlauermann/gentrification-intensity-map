This repository contains code and data related to a national longitudinal tract database on gentrification patterns in American cities. It contains two data products:

#### Gentrification patterns on 2020 tract boundaries
Gentrification-related data from 1990 to 2020, adjusted to 2020 census tract boundaries. This is based on Decennial Census and American Community Survey data, drawn from [National Historical GIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) using the [IPUMS API](ttps://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/get-started/). Crosswalks are based on the [NHGIS Geographic Crosswalk](https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks) methodology. 

#### Historical data on 2010 tract boundaries
Gentrification indicators from 1970 to 2020, adjusted to 2010 census tract boundaries. This is base don Decennial Census and American Community Survey data, drawn from from [National Historical GIS](https://www.nhgis.org/)using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/get-started/). Crosswalks are based on methods from both [NHGIS Geographic Crosswalks](https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks) and the [Longitudinal Tract Data Base](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/researcher/bridging.htm).
